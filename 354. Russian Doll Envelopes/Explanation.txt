At first we will sort out the input array by width asc and if two width is same then sort them by height desc.

Now we will apply **LIS(Longest Increasing Subsequence)** in the height segment. 
The idea is to insert each element in a **temp** vector if **Wi > latest_item** in our temp vector.
Otherwise we will find suitable position for **Wi** and insert it in that position replacing previous one.

Finally counting the size of temp will give us the result.
