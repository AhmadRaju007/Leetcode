The demand of the question is to get INCREASING and DECREASING sequences alternating.
Now re-arranging of array is not possible, Hence NUMBER OF TIMES ARRAY CHANGES from increasing to decreasing & vice versa REMAINS CONSTANT.

The question can now reduced to find number of times array changes pattern.
Further , it can be deduced that we have to COUNT THE NUMBER OF PEAKS AND VALLEY POINTS.

Complexity: O(n)
